# WindKiller
Window Killer for Windows
This is mostly just a fun project to test myself with some OOP, the Windows API, and learn the ctypes module

## How to Use
1. Once file is cloned/downloaded, open up a terminal and `cd` to the directory you place the program in
2. Type `python WindKiller.py`
3. Enter the EXACT name of the window you want to terminate and hit `enter`

## Errors
Two of the error codes you might run into are error codes 5 & 6

### Error Code 5
This is for access denied and can usually be solved by elvating the privliges of the terminal that you are using 

### Error Code 6
This is for an invalid handle/window name so just check how you typed the window name in
